# 👋 Hi, I'm Neeraj

I'm a developer focused on web technologies and hardware programming. I’ve built and published a [Portfolio](https://serial-commit-dev.github.io/My-Portfolio/) of my own using GitHub Pages, and I’m currently learning C++ through Arduino projects.

My journey started with HTML and CSS, and I’ve been learning by building, experimenting, and using AI tools to support my growth. I'm also looking forward to working with Raspberry Pi to expand my hardware skills.

### 🛠️ Skills & Tools

- **Languages**: HTML, CSS, C++
- **Platforms**: GitHub Pages
- **IDEs**: WebStorm
- **Hardware**: Arduino (basic projects), exploring Raspberry Pi

---

### 📚 Current Focus

- Building responsive websites with HTML & CSS
- Programming Arduino with C++
- Getting started with Raspberry Pi
- Learning through hands-on experimentation

### 🌐 Recent API Project

I recently started learning about APIs and quickly built a JavaScript project that connects to the SheetDB API. This project sends, retrieves, and validates data in a Google Sheet, with error handling and clear test results.  
It’s been a fun way to dive into backend concepts, HTTP methods (GET, POST), and real-world data integration—all within days of starting my API journey!
