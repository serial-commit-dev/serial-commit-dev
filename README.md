# 👋 Hi, I'm Neeraj

I'm a developer working with web technologies and hardware. I published my [Portfolio](https://serial-commit-dev.github.io/My-Portfolio/) via GitHub Pages and I'm learning C++ through Arduino projects.

I began with HTML and CSS and learn by building, experimenting, and using AI tools. Next up: Raspberry Pi to grow my hardware and IoT skills.

### 📚 Current Focus

- Building responsive websites (HTML & CSS) and integrating APIs 
- Programming Arduino with C++ 
- Getting started with Raspberry Pi and IoT/API integration  
- Learning by hands-on experimentation, testing, and error-handling best practices
- Learning JavaScript basics and applying it to frontend projects, mainly for API integrations and interactivity (working with HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
