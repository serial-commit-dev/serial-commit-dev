# 👋 Hi, I'm Neeraj

I'm a developer focused on web technologies and hardware programming. I’ve built and published a [Portfolio](https://serial-commit-dev.github.io/My-Portfolio/) of my own using GitHub Pages, and I’m currently learning C++ through Arduino projects.

My journey started with HTML and CSS, and I’ve been learning by building, experimenting, and using AI tools to support my growth. I'm also looking forward to working with Raspberry Pi to expand my hardware skills.
